# Setting Things Up

`sudo ./setup.sh`

This script will prompt you for your LDAP server name and credentials that will allow you to connect and verify AD credentials. Additionally, it will install all of the necessary software and setup PAM (pluggable authentication modules) for SSH. Users will first authenticate (behind the scenes) against LDAP if they already have a home directory on the server. If the user does not already have a home directory then they will not be able to authenticate (see Add Users below). Note that when LDAP authentication fails then PAM will continue along with its regularly scheduled authentication process.

# Add Users 

This will add a user, setup their home directory, and initialize their bash environment

`sudo useradd -m <username> -s /bin/bash`

# Delete Users

`sudo userdel <username>`

`sudo rm -rf /home/<username>`

# Setup NVIDIA 1080Ti Graphics Card
